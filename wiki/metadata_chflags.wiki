#
chflags(2) (`st_flags`) metadata support. Per-file settable attributes. Typically implemented on BSD platforms.
#

#
== Metadata supported ==
#

#
For platforms that support them:
#

#
  * User No Dump
#
  * User Immutable
#
  * User Append
#
  * User Opaque
#
  * System Archived
#
  * System Immutable

#
== Implementation status ==
#

#
Implemented since repository revision 92 (2007-01-29).
#

#
== Notes ==
#

#
  * Note that some flags have overlap and may be duplicated with other metadata support. Most notably this happens with [metadata_linux_attrib Linux EXT2 file attributes].
#
  * Archival of flags is implemented using the `st_flags` struct member of the [metadata_stat stat metadata] on platforms that support it.
#
  * Extraction of flags is implemented using the chflags(2) APIs on platforms that support it.
