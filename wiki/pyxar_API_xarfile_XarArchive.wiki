== XarArchive(name, mode = 'r') ==

This class provides an interface to a xar archive file.  Each archive member is represented by a XarInfo object.

The XarArchive class provides methods for accessing members and subdocs, and additionally provides a standard Python container API.

==== open() ====

  Open the XarArchive

==== close() ====

  Close the XarArchive.  This method is called implicitly upon deallocation, if not explicitly prior.

=== Accessing Members ===

  ==== getmembers(...) ====
    Return the members as a list of XarInfo objects.

  ==== getmember(...) ====
    Return a XarInfo object for the member

  ==== getnames(...) ====
    Return the members as a list of their names.

  ==== items(...) ====
    Return a list of tuples of (name, member) for the members in the archive.

  ==== get(...) ====
    Return the member for the given name, or the given default if the name doesn't exist

  ==== has_key(...) ====
    Return whether the archive contains the given name

  ==== iteritems(...) ====

  ==== iterkeys(...) ====

  ==== itervalues(...) ====
 
  ==== keys(...) ====

  ==== values(...) ====

=== Accessing Subdocs ===

  ==== getsubdoc(...) ====
    Return a XarSubdoc object for the subdoc of the given name

  ==== getsubdocnames(...) ====
    Return a list of the names of each subdoc in the archive.

  ==== getsubdocs(...) ====
    Return a list of XarSubdoc objects for each subdoc in the archive.

  ==== addsubdoc(...) ====
    Adds the given subdoc to the xar archive.  Subdoc is assumed to be an instance of XarSubdoc, but if not, it is assumed to be a path to an xml file that can be used to create a XarSubdoc instance.

  ==== removesubdoc(...) ====
    Remove the subdoc of the given name from the archive.





     |  add(...)
     |      Add a file (or directory) to the archive, if the archive is
     |      writable.  If the name is a directory, and recursive is
     |      True, then add the directory recursively.
     |  
     |  addfile(...)
     |  
     |  
     |  close(...)
     |      Close the XarArchive.  This method is called implicitly upon
     |      deallocation, if not explicitly prior.

     |  extract(...)
     |      Extract the member to the given path, or the current
     |      directory if no path is given. If no member is given, every 
     |      file in the archive is extracted to the given path, or the 
     |      current directory.
     |  
     |  
     |  
     |  
     |  getxarinfo(...)
     |      Create a XarInfo object for the given file name that is NOT
     |      in the XarArchive.
