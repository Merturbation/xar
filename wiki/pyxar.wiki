#labels pyxar
pyxar!  The Python bindings for xar.

= Introduction =

The Python bindings for xar currently include a single Python module, xarfile, which attempts to be as compatible with the Python tarfile module as reasonably possible.

pyxar is currently under active development, and as such, is incomplete. A brief "todo" list of known issues/unimplemented features is included below.

There existed a previous Python module for xar, simply named xar, but it has been deprecated.

= Todo =

 * Most errors are not properly handled
 * XarFile should implement Python container methods
 * XarFile needs general clean-up and organization to remove the redundant code
 * XarInfo filetype methods needs implementing
