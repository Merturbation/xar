#summary pyxar!  The Python bindings for xar.
#labels pyxar

= Introduction =

The Python bindings for xar currently include a single Python module, [pyxar_API_xarfile xarfile], which attempts to be as compatible with the Python tarfile module as reasonably possible.

pyxar is currently under active development, and as such, is incomplete. A brief "todo" list of known issues/unimplemented features is included below.

There existed a previous Python module for xar, simply named xar, but it has been deprecated.

=Download=

pyxar has been tested to work with Python 2.4 and 2.5, and has the following requirements:

 * [http://code.google.com/p/xar xar] must be installed.
 * The Python module [http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python/Pyrex/ pyrex] must be installed.

You can get pyxar from xar's Subversion repository:
pyxar is currently only available from xar's Subversion repository.  It can be checked-out individually:

{{{
svn checkout http://xar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/python pyxar
}}}

If you're checking out the entire xar repository, pyxar is located in the python subdirectory.

To build pyxar:

{{{
python setup.py build
}}}

To install pyxar:
{{{
python setup.py install
}}}

=Documentation=

pyxar's API documentation is currently available in the [http://code.google.com/p/xar/wiki/pyxar_API_xarfile xar project wiki]. This covers the pieces of pyxar that are implemented, and should function as described. As new features are added, they will appear in this documentation.

= Issues/Todo =

 * Most errors are not properly handled
 * [pyxar_API_xarfile_XarArchive XarArchive] should implement Python container methods
 * [pyxar_API_xarfile_XarArchive XarArchive] needs general clean-up and organization to remove the redundant code
 * [pyxar_API_xarfile_XarInfo XarInfo] filetype methods needs implementing
